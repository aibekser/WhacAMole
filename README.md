# 🎮 Mario: Whac-A-Mole Game

A simple Whac-A-Mole game written in Java using Swing, featuring characters inspired by the Mario universe. Test your reflexes by whacking Monty Moles and avoiding the Piranha Plants!

## 🧠 How It Works

The game presents a 3x3 grid of buttons. Every second, a Monty Mole (mole icon) will randomly appear in one of the tiles. Every 1.5 seconds, a Piranha Plant may appear. The objective is to click the mole to score points, but avoid clicking on the plant — or it's game over!

## 🕹️ Controls

- **Click on a mole** to earn 10 points.
- **Avoid clicking on the plant** — clicking it ends the game.
